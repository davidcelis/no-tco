# No t.co

no-tco is a Safari Extension that replaces all t.co links on [Twitter](https://twitter.com) with their original, expanded URLs. Links on t.co, especially on Safari, tend to be slow and time out frequently. This extension provides a better experience by taking you directly to the originally submitted URL quickly and safely.
